This is a simple implementation of "Rock, Paper, Scissors" game where the user can play against the computer. The program first imports the `random` module to generate random choices for the computer. It then defines ASCII art representations for rock, paper, and scissors and stores them in multi-line string variables. These strings are collected into a list named `game_images`.

The user is prompted to input their choice by typing `0` for rock, `1` for paper, or `2` for scissors. The program tries to convert the user's input into an integer and checks if the input is valid (i.e., within the range of 0 to 2). If the input is invalid, it prints an error message, and the user loses by default.

If the input is valid, the program prints the ASCII art corresponding to the user's choice. The computer's choice is then randomly generated using `random.randint(0, 2)`, and its corresponding ASCII art is printed.

The game logic then determines the winner by comparing the user's choice with the computer's choice based on the traditional rules of "Rock, Paper, Scissors":
- Rock (0) beats Scissors (2)
- Scissors (2) beats Paper (1)
- Paper (1) beats Rock (0)

The program uses a series of `if-elif-else` statements to decide the outcome:
- If the user chooses rock and the computer chooses scissors, the user wins.
- If the computer chooses rock and the user chooses scissors, the user loses.
- If the computer's choice is greater than the user's choice, the user loses (except for the specific rock-scissors case handled above).
- If the user's choice is greater than the computer's choice, the user wins.
- If both choices are the same, it's a draw.

Finally, the program prints the result of the game, indicating whether the user wins, loses, or if it's a draw. If the input conversion fails (i.e., the user enters a non-integer value), a `ValueError` is caught, and the program prints an error message indicating the input is invalid and the user loses.
